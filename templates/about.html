      <h3>About Payroll Management System</h3>
      <p>
        Payroll Management System is a function in organizations designed to maximize employee performance of an employer's strategic
        objectives. HR is primarily concerned with the management of people within organizations, focusing on policies and
        systems. HR departments and units in organizations typically undertake a number of activities, including employee
        recruitment, training and development, performance appraisal, and rewarding (e.g., managing pay and benefit systems).
        HR is also concerned with industrial relations, that is, the balancing of organizational practices with requirements
        arising from collective bargaining and from governmental laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        HR is a product of the human relations movement of the early 20th century, when researchers began documenting ways of creating
        business value through the strategic management of the workforce. The function was initially dominated by transactional
        work, such as payroll and benefits administration, but due to globalization, company consolidation, technological
        advances, and further research, HR as of 2015 focuses on strategic initiatives like mergers and acquisitions, talent
        management, succession planning, industrial and labor relations, and diversity and inclusion.
